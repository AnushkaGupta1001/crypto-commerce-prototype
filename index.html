        <h3>Why Crypto-Based Brands Need More Than Just a Marketplace</h3>
        <p>NFT platforms like <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/crypto-stitch" target="_blank">OpenSea</a>, Rarible, and Foundation have created a booming industry, but they all share a common limitation — a lack of immersive user experience.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Problem:</strong> Most NFT marketplaces function like traditional e-commerce platforms. They're great for browsing but lack real engagement and interactivity.</li>
          <li><strong>Solution:</strong> AI-powered personalized storefronts and interactive 3D environments can transform passive browsing into an engaging, gamified experience.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>By integrating AI, blockchain, and 3D visualization, brands can build experiential commerce — a new frontier in the Web3 ecosystem.</p>
